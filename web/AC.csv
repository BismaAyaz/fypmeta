"my HSC part 2 enrollment card missed what can i do??"
please confirm   only color copy of admit card will be acceptable on test day OR black & white is also ok?
My admit card is not open in pdf what can i do
Like I said  when I try to download the admit card it opens a pdf downloaded and from that app I get that pdf file is invalid 
It's showing my admit card of invalid format but every thing is correct please tell me what to do.
Is there any documents accept admit card and ssc certificate to be attested ?
